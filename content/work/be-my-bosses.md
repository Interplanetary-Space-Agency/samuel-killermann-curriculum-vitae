Be My Boss(es) is a splash page for my Patreon profile, explaining how I am doing Patreon, and patronage, for anyone who wants to employ me.

I built it with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and it's being served up with [Netlify](http://netlify.com) -- just like [this site](https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/samuel-killermann-curriculum-vitae/) you're reading this on.
