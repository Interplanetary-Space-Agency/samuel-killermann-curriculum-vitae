"Have you ever been in a training and marveled at how quickly the time flew by?

Genuinely enjoyed a meeting you were expecting to dread? Learned something powerful about a topic you thought wouldn't engage you? Experienced an intimate, vulnerable, transformative moment with a group of total strangers? Then you've witnessed the magic of facilitation." (excerpt from the [book description](https://www.amazon.com/Unlocking-Magic-Facilitation-Sam-Killermann/dp/0989760235))

I wrote _Unlocking the Magic of Facilitation_ with Meg Bolger, after spending a few years doing train-the-trainers with her through [The Safe Zone Project](http://thesafezoneproject.com). We set out to put down all the things we weren't able to get to in every training, and would regret not being able to share.
