An experiment in gift economy and social justice, SJC is where I serve as Head Elf.

The cards are all doodled and written by me, but that's not the important part.

What's exciting about this project was the bar I set for myself: can I create a business that sells a physical thing that is 100% socially/environmentally/globally just. That is, that doesn't create harm or compromise in any way.

SJC is what was born.

From recycled materials, to plant-based ink, to carbon offsets, to positive messaging, to gift-economy pricing -- Socially Just Cards is an experiment through and through.
