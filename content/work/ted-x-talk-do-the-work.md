My third (and final) TEDxTalk, where I present a sort of unified theory of social justice, explaining what it means to "do the work," and how we can do it.

I performed this talk at TEDxYouth in San Diego for the theme "We Can't Wait." I combined theories from some of my favorite thinkers to create a road map for aspiring social justice advocates.

Unfortunately, due to technical difficulties (?), videos from the event that year were never posted to TED's site or YouTube.

So these photos from the event will have to suffice ðŸ˜”
