My third (and final) TEDxTalk, where I present a sort of unified theory of social justice, explaining what it means to "do the work," and how we can do it.

I performed this talk at TEDxYouth in San Diego for the theme "We Can't Wait." I combined theories from some of my favorite thinkers to create a road map for aspiring social justice advocates.

Unfortunately, due to technical difficulties, video from the event didn't make it to TED's site or YouTube. This, in addition to the stress of writing/prepping/performing this talk, is why I've declared this my final TEDxTalk.

In lieu of the video, these photos by the event photographer will have to suffice:
