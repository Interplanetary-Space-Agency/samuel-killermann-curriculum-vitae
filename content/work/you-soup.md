You have been told all your life that you‚Äôre unique, you‚Äôre special, like a snowflake.  Nobody is like you, you‚Äôre one in 7 billion (or one in 108 billion, an estimated total number of humans ever, if you want to get technical), and nobody can take that away from you.

Yet at the same time you‚Äôve been told that you can guess that someone else will be like everyone else in a particular group based on their membership in that group (e.g., a gay person will be like gay people).  And in your life you‚Äôve seen evidence that supports this idea.

So which is true?

Both.
