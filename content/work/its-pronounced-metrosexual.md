I wrote the show that became "It's Pronounced Metrosexual" while I was in grad school.

It was my "Plan B" for if I don't find a job in higher education. We were still in a recession, and jobs were tough to come by.

The online resource aspect of IPM, by about 100-fold the most popular byproduct of the site, was the result of a suggestion by my partner at the time.

Today, I travel to perform the show, and regularly contribute to the online resource by writing articles and doodling edugraphics.
