"When many of us start facilitating, we find ourselves learning a new skill without a lot of guidance or direction. We are passionate about the information and content that we are communicating, but weâ€™re often less versed in tips and techniques regarding how to communicate that information.

This project is a free online resource that is to ensure that none of us have to navigate this world of facilitation without guidance, direction, or support.

We call it FacilitatingXYZ: A Free Online Resource for ALL Facilitators. On this site, we feature videos on facilitation techniques, articles, and downloadable resources. This project is a community creation, with input from facilitators of all disciplines, and itâ€™s co-facilitated by Meg Bolger, Sam Killermann and Kaleigh Cornelison."
