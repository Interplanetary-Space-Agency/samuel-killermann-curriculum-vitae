This is the project that led to The New York Times publishing "[Killermann is] perfectly O.K. with being known as the toilet sign guy."

Damn right I am, New York Times! Nothing would make me happier.

You can read all about [how this sign came to be on It's Pronounced Metrosexual](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2014/07/how-the-gender-neutral-bathroom-sign-i-made-is-being-manufactured-and-donated-to-colleges/), and I won't repeat myself here. What I'll say instead are a few things that I don't think I've written:

1. I'm still floored _every time_ I see this sign in public. And I see it on a regular basis -- in restaurants, airports, schools, everywhere. It makes me so happy.
2. As a self-taught graphic designer (with no degrees or formal education whatsoever), I'm more proud of this doodle than pretty much anything else I've done. I never thought something so seemingly-boring could be such a regular source of personal excitement.
3. If you ever see my toilet in the wild and think "Hey, that's Sam's toilet. Neat.", I will know (on some level) and my heart will smile.
