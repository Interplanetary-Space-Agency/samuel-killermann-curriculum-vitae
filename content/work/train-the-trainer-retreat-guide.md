As part of our ongoing Train-the-Trainer Toolkit, Meg & I wrote and published a comprehensive retreat guide for Safe Zone Train-the-Trainers.

It includes (from the <a href="https://thesafezoneproject.com/introducing-safe-zone-train-the-trainer-retreat-guide/" title="Safe Zone Blog Post">blog post announcement</a>):

- All the individual activities weâ€™d recommend for a TTT, from the LGBTQ+ content knowledge to the facilitator skills
- Advice on logistics, participant selection, supplies, prep, etc.
- A retreat schedule with detailed walkthroughs for every step
And a whole lot more.

Like with our Foundational Curriculum, we offer this to you as editable Google Docs for your customizing convenience.

You can <a href="https://thesafezoneproject.com/ttt" title="Get the Retreat Guide">get the guide today</a>, and start planning your retreat immediately.
