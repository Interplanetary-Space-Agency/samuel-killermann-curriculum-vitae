"A book about gender with no mention of the word 'hegemony,' but plenty of references to Star Wars, The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, and Star Trek-- with less of a focus on overwhelming scholarship and more of a focus on enjoyable learning." (excerpt from the [book's (first edition) description](https://www.amazon.com/Social-Justice-Advocates-Handbook-Gender/dp/0989760200))

I wrote this book because a bunch of people asked me to. It was a synthesis of the ideas (1) I had been [blogging about](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/all); (2) I'd been [speaking about](http://samtalkto.us); and (3) that helped me better understand _my_ gender, when I first set down the path of understanding.

## Second Edition

The first edition was adopted as part of their syllabi by so many Gender Studies professors that I had to amend the introduction. I also had some other things to fix. **The second edition was released on March 15, 2017**, and includes:

- **A New Foreword** addressing how the book is being used, and how things changed over Times
- **New Chapters** filling in some gaps from the 1st Ed
- **All-Gender Restroom Sign** as the back cover, for readers who want to do a little guerrilla activism
