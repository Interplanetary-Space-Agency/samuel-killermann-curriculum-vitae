I co-created the Sexualitree model with friend / sex educator / curriculum writer extraordinaire [Karen Rayne](http://karenrayne.com). We put our heads together to help sex educators introduce a popular concept to students: "comprehensive sexuality education."

From the [About page](http://sexualitree.org/about/):

> "The Sexualitree is a way to see how we experience sexuality in different ways. Sexuality affects us on different levels of our lives, and each person uniquely."

We've created supplemental materials to help educators use the model, and it's been implemented in dozens of curricula. As examples, check out:

- This [article I wrote](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2016/05/sexualitree-model-of-comprehensive-sexuality/) to introduce the Sexualitree
- Or this [Using the Sexualitree in the Classroom Guide](http://sexualitree.org/use) Karen wrote
