"Every shirt is political. It’s not just about what a shirt says on the front; it’s about what you’re saying when you buy it or wear it.

If you buy a shirt that was manufactured with unethical labor, you’re making a statement in favor of abuse. The same goes for the corporation who you buy it from, or the materials it’s made with." (from the [About Page](https://everyshirtispolitical.com/about/))
