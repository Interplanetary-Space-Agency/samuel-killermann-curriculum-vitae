Sam Killermann is an artist, author, and award-winning activist who focuses on themes of gender, sexuality, and global justice. Through his free online resources, books, curricula, and comedy shows, Sam travels the globe telling a story about a possible future where everyone is healthy, understood, educated, and safe.

Killermann's work (that he uncopyrighted in 2013) has been downloaded by hundreds of millions of people around the world who utilize it to bolster their educational efforts toward global equity. His versions of the [Genderbread Person](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/03/the-genderbread-person-v2-0/), a model for understanding and teaching gender and sexual diversity, have been translated into over a dozen languages.

He gave a well-received [TEDxTalk](http://youtu.be/NRcPXtqdKjE) that has over 350,000 views called "Understanding the Complexities of Gender," where he distilled the themes of the book into a few minutes of fun, energetic, and easily-digestible speech.
