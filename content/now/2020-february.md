<p class="dropCap">January was a month of public thinking. I wrote and published <a href="https://www.samkillermann.com/topics/sjmd-book" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 300 pages of a new book on my blog</a>. February is for editing, solidifying, and lining up the publishing.</p>

This book will be the culmination of a lot of the work I've been doing for the past few years. Writing about [social justice dogma at IPM](https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/tags/social-justice-dogma), [attempting a podcast](https://hereticpodcast.com), [creating and launching a course](https://www.sjmd.space), and more.

It's also, in a lot of ways, a memoir of sorts, following my entire adult life of activism and social justice advocacy -- from the beginnings of my time as a professional gender & sexuality educator, social justice comedian, and author, up until today.

My goal has been to write something _for_ social justice people (i.e., my people, me) to advance the goals of social justice. It's an [unabashedly progressive](https://www.samkillermann.com/radical-fringe/) collection of writing, with dismantling oppression in its sights. But the approach I'm taking isn't one that we're used to in Social Justice Land.

**The book is _about_ problematic activism** -- dogma, orthodoxy, absolutism, and fundamentalism -- and the ways we're creating problems that stand in the way of our solutions, barriers blocking us from living social justice.

**And it's also an _act of_ problematic activism.** The table of contents is basically a long list of things we're not supposed to talk about, ask about, wonder, or push back against -- lest we be cast as "one of the bad ones," part of the problem.

(I shared a link to the [work-in-progress table of contents on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/33980604) if you want to see what I mean.)

Writing it has felt like walking a tightrope without a safety net. 

Fall one way and I'm branded as "problematic" by my fellow activists, canceled; fall the other and I contribute more problematic activism to a movement that's already struggling.

We'll see if I can pull it off.

Cross your fingers for me,

P.S. If you want to read a preview, I created a mailing list for the book and you'll get a .PDF with a few selected chapters.

P.P.S. If you work for a publisher who might be interested in acquiring this book (or are connected to one), I'd love to hear from you. I have [some publishing deal-breakers](https://www.samkillermann.com/book-freely-accessible/), but I'm otherwise super flexible, easy to work with, and excited to talk details. I'm hoping to have this book out _really_ soon, like Spring 2020 soon, so let's talk!
