<p class="dropCap">Yesterday, I sent emails to several thousand people, making the <a href="https://www.sjmd.space" title="Social Justice, Minus Dogma Online Course + Community">Social Justice, Minus Dogma Online Course + Community</a> as official as it will ever be. Within moments, we had 7 people enrolled. Within 30 minutes, I was reviewing the first submitted response from a student.</p>

That was a little bewildering to me.

Someone who, before getting that email, couldn't _have possibly_ been expecting to enroll in a 6-week course during lunch, was already halfway through orientation before I had finished sending everyone emails about it. Amazing. That person made my month.

**SJMD has been most of my June, and will be my July and August too, at least.** I'll be:

- releasing the modules for the course (one each week for the next 6 weeks),
- reviewing student replies and course material submissions,
- co-facilitating the online community,
- manually enrolling new members who can't afford tuition every day (that's the hope, at least -- already added four!),
- squashing bugs in the code in any of the 7+ websites that make this thing possible, and
- working with the community to identify a walkable path forward for social justice advocates.

But my life won't be 100% SJMD.

What else will be going on? Let's see...

I'll be in Austin all month, other than a weekend in Chicago. I'm excited to spend time with both pups loves ([yep! two now!](https://www.instagram.com/p/BxiOHs4FiQ2/)), and my now-outnumbered human love.

Oh, and I'm [still working on Facilitator Cards](https://www.samuelkillermann.com/now/2019-april/), and will be doing the annual [Safe Zone Project birthday update](https://thesafezoneproject.com/new-curriculum-internship-program-more-our-4th-birthday-update/) with Meg in July.

Happy summer you beautiful souls,
