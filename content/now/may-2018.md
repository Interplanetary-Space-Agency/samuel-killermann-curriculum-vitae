I'm writing from a coffee shop in Austin, TX where I just spent two hours trying to get this site to deploy on [Netlify](http://netlify.com). Annnnd success?

Success.

This site is part of a huge life restructuring I'm currently undertaking. I [wrote about it on my blog](http://samkillermann.com/after-7-years-doing-this-work-im-re-branding-heres-how-im-making-decisions/), but here's the highlighted version:

1. My primary org ([hues](http://hues.xyz)) dissolved in its original vision at the beginning of this year
2. I'm [no longer with a speaking/talent agency](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2018/02/announcement-im-no-longer-affiliated-talent-agency-manager/) (for the first time in half a decade)
3. And as a result, I've started to rethink everything I do, mostly in the "Can I, and/or do I want to, keep doing this thing?"

A lot of my answers to #3 have been "No."

However, here are a couple of the things I'm going to keep doing, and what I'll be working on this month:

- **Creating curricula and resources for [The Safe Zone Project](http://thesafezoneproject.com)**. We'll have a birthday update this July with lots of new stuff.
- **Recording and producing the new podcast [Heretic: Social Justice, Minus Dogma](http://hereticpodcast.com).** This got set-back with the above setbacks, but I'll be doing it independently, with a hopeful May release.
- **Making cool stuff that I want for myself available to others on [The hues Store](http://hues.xyz).** This is a new thing! The hues Store grabbed the hues.xyz domain, and I moved the hues Collective site to healthyunderstoodeducatedsafe.com (catchy, I know).
- **Publishing weekly content at [IPM](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com) and [my blog](http://samkillermann.com).** I started this trend about a month ago, and I'm going to keep it up for the next several weeks.

Finally, the most important update of my life ever: my partner and I are looking for a dog. A DOG!

K, that's it for now. Got to get back to working on this site. I have about 200 pages to port over from the old Wordpress Site I was originally using for my online CV.
