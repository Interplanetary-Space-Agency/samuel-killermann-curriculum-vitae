Let's be honest: about pages are pretty bleh. For a more fun idea, check out the ["now" page](../now/) on this site.

Okay, now that I've gotten that off my chest &mdash; Hi! I'm Sam, and I wear a lot of hats. If you've poked around this site, specifically the [work page](../work/), you've likely already figured that out.

I'm not really sure what you want to know about me, so I'll do my best to answer the most common questions I get asked from crowd members and readers.

## The Short Explanation

Here's how I describe myself on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/killermann) (at the time of writing this page):

> Activist / Social justice comedian. Author. Storyteller. Sexuality & Gender Educator. "Heâ€™s perfectly O.K. with being known as the toilet sign guy." -@NYTimes

That last thing is my favorite brag. If you want to read more professional bio stuff and work brags, click over to [my bio](../bio).

## How I Pay Rent

The question I get asked the most: "You give away everything you make for free... how... do you afford... life?"

It is true that I spend most of my time creating free things for the internet, and that I've uncopyrighted all of my work.

In light of that, for the past several years, I have primarily earned a living from...

- performing [social justice comedy shows](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/campus-programs/);
- [speaking](http://samtalkto.us) at events; and
- royalties from [my books](https://www.amazon.com/Sam-Killermann/e/B00F9CIDGM).

Something that's super new, but I'm excited about, is starting to adopt the "patronage" way of doing things. So I'll be hoping to, in the coming months, be less reliant on traveling and speaking and more able to just make things.

The two main places folks can patronize (?) me are:

- http://patreon.com/killermann - for general supporters/members, who want to say thanks or get access to exclusive goodies
- http://patreon.com/itspronouncedmetrosexual - specifically for fans of the IPM site who want to help me pay the (super hefty) hosting bill

## Social Media Profiles &amp; Presence

I don't really use social media. I find it to be a consistent mind-suck, with the occasional feeling of Hellmouth. That said, here are the accounts I keep somewhat active:

- [Twitter: @killermann](http://twitter.com/killermann)
- [Instagram: @killermann](http://instagram.com/killermann)
- [Facebook/Killermann](http://facebook.com/killermann) - my "personal" profile (but almost everything I post there is public)
- [Facebook/SamKillermann](http://facebook.com/samkillermann) - my general Facebook fanpage
- [Facebook/MetroSam](http://facebook.com/metrosam) - the fanpage for "It's Pronounced Metrosexual"

Profiles: plenty. Presence: pitiful.

## Personal Deets?

People ask about these things a lot, so here they are:

- **Born** in Chicago on July 21, 1987 (but I only lived there until I was 2)
- **Lived** in more homes than I can count, from the Midwest to the Midwest
- **Live** in Austin, TX. The best city in the US
- **Went to college** at Purdue University, and **grad school** at Bowling Green State University

That's all, folks.

Oh, other than one more thing: did you know the ðŸ¤— emoji was supposed to be a hug? I didn't. I thought it was just an overly excited person waving with both hands at once (AKA me in a nutshell).
