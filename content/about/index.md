We run all digital marketing, analytics, and improve ecommerce revenue. You never pay us. EVER.

We are marketing profesionals. We understand running lean startups and not having spare cash. _But we also_ understand the need for an **out of this world digital agency**. That's us.

What we need from you:

- A buisness that is brining in _at least_ $25k in yearly revenue. (Don't worry, we handle bigger clients. This is just our minimum.)
- A need for growth.
- The ability to work with a buissness partner.

What we provide to you:

- A kickass group of people to run Google Analytics, Email Marketing, Google Ads, Instagram ads, Facebook ads, Reddit ads, and just about any platform you'd want to be on.
- All content, graphics, and editing required for digital advertising.
- A complete "done for you" attitude. We bring our A game everyday.

What we don't provide to you:

- Invoices. You will **never receive a bill for our services.**

>How are we able to provde you with the revolutionary buisness model?

Simple. We only partner with people we beleive in. We know talented people when we see them. We will have an into call for both of us to see if we are the right fit for each other. If we think you can succeed, and you think we can help, we then agree on a portion of equity in return for our services.

Doing it this way allows you to have a world class digital marketing agency at no operational cost to you. We make our money by growing the buisness and either maintaing our stakehold or by exiting if you choose to be aquirrered.

Still have questions? Just ask.
