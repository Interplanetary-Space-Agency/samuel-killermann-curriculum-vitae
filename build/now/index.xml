      <description>You hear me, baby? Hold together! Got him! I got him! Great kid! Don&amp;rsquo;t get cocky. There are still two more of them out there! That&amp;rsquo;s it! We did it! We did it! Help! I think I&amp;rsquo;m melting! This is all your fault.
There&amp;rsquo;s nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You&amp;rsquo;d have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire. I want to come with you to Alderaan.</description>

      <description>Kid, I&amp;rsquo;ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen anything to make me believe there&amp;rsquo;s one all-powerful force controlling everything. There&amp;rsquo;s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.
It&amp;rsquo;s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. With the blast shield down, I can&amp;rsquo;t even see.</description>
