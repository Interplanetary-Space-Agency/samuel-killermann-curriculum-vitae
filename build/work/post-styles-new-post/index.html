<p>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they&rsquo;ve obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t we just leave this party? What kept you? We ran into some old friends. Is the ship all right? Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. Look! Come on, Artoo, we&rsquo;re going! Now&rsquo;s our chance! Go! No! Come on! Come on! Luke, its too late! Blast the door! Kid!</p>

<p>Look at the size of that thing! Cut the chatter, Red Two. Accelerate to attack speed. This is it, boys! Red Leader, this is Gold Leader. I copy, Gold Leader. We&rsquo;re starting for the target shaft now. We&rsquo;re in position. I&rsquo;m going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire. Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-degrees. I see it. Stay low. This is Red Five, I&rsquo;m going in! Luke, pull up! Are you all right? I got a little cooked, but I&rsquo;m okay.</p>

<p>What are you doing hiding there? It wasn&rsquo;t my fault, sir. Please don&rsquo;t deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he&rsquo;s faulty, malfunctioning, kept babbling on about his mission. Oh, no! That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can&rsquo;t understand their logic at times. How could I be so stupid? He&rsquo;s nowhere in sight. Blast it! Pardon me, sir, but couldn&rsquo;t we go after him? It&rsquo;s too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We&rsquo;ll have to wait until morning. Luke, I&rsquo;m shutting the power down for the night. All right, I&rsquo;ll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it. You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. Oh, he excels at that, sir.</p>

<p>Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It&rsquo;s an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Now, let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from. I saw part of the message he was&hellip; I seem to have found it.</p>
