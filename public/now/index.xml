Someone who, before getting that email, couldn't have possibly been expecting to enroll in a 6-week course during lunch, was already halfway through orientation before I had finished sending everyone emails about it. Amazing. That person made my month.
SJMD has been most of my June, and will be my July and August too, at least. I'll be:
releasing the modules for the course (one each week for the next 6 weeks), reviewing student replies and course material submissions, co-facilitating the online community, manually enrolling new members who can't afford tuition every day (that's the hope, at least &amp;ndash; already added four!</description></item><item><title>Social Justice, Minus Dogma + Facilitator Cards</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/now/2019-april/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/now/2019-april/</guid><description>One is a Social Justice, Minus Dogma Online Course &amp;amp; Community, which lives at www.sjmd.space.
