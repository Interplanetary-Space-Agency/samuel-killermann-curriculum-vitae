<p>There&rsquo;s nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You&rsquo;d have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There&rsquo;s nothing here for me now.</p>

<p>You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. How long have you had these droids? About three or four seasons. They&rsquo;re for sale if you want them.</p>

        <section class="post-content"><p>Kid, I&rsquo;ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I&rsquo;ve never seen anything to make me believe there&rsquo;s one all-powerful force controlling everything. There&rsquo;s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. With the blast shield down, I can&rsquo;t even see. How am I supposed to fight? Your eyes can deceive you. Don&rsquo;t trust them.</p>

<p>Here they come! They&rsquo;re coming in too fast! Oooh! We&rsquo;ve lost lateral controls. Don&rsquo;t worry, she&rsquo;ll hold together. You hear me, baby? Hold together! Got him! I got him! Great kid! Don&rsquo;t get cocky. There are still two more of them out there! That&rsquo;s it! We did it! We did it! Help! I think I&rsquo;m melting! This is all your fault.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You&rsquo;d have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire. I want to come with you to Alderaan.
