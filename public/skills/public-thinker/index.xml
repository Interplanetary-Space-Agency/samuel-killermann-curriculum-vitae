We’re thrilled to meet you.&amp;rdquo;
Social Justice, Minus Dogma is a continuation of the work I've been doing for the past few years confronting the social justice dogma.</description></item><item><title>Be My Boss(es)</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/be-my-bosses/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/be-my-bosses/</guid><description>Be My Boss(es) is a splash page for my Patreon profile, explaining how I am doing Patreon, and patronage, for anyone who wants to employ me.
I built it with Hugo and it's being served up with Netlify &amp;ndash; just like this site you're reading this on.</description></item><item><title>The Heretic Podcast</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/heretic/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/heretic/</guid><description>With guest activists, authors, and artists who have who have been pushed to the fringes by the movement, spent their lives fighting for social justice, or fighting against it, Heretic is a light conversation about the darkness in society.
It's also the scariest thing I've ever done.
I started writing about The Social Justice Dogma on It's Pronounced Metrosexual in December of 2017.
Visual Design + Identity The branding of Heretic is sunny day at the beach meets Da Vinci Code.</description></item><item><title>Unlocking the Magic of Facilitation</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/unlocking-the-magic-of-facilitation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/unlocking-the-magic-of-facilitation/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Have you ever been in a training and marveled at how quickly the time flew by?
Genuinely enjoyed a meeting you were expecting to dread? Learned something powerful about a topic you thought wouldn't engage you? Experienced an intimate, vulnerable, transformative moment with a group of total strangers? Then you've witnessed the magic of facilitation.&amp;rdquo; (excerpt from the book description)
I wrote Unlocking the Magic of Facilitation with Meg Bolger, after spending a few years doing train-the-trainers with her through The Safe Zone Project.</description></item><item><title>All Gender Restroom Sign</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/all-gender-restroom-sign/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/all-gender-restroom-sign/</guid><description>This is the project that led to The New York Times publishing &amp;ldquo;[Killermann is] perfectly O.K. with being known as the toilet sign guy.&amp;rdquo;
Damn right I am, New York Times! Nothing would make me happier.
You can read all about how this sign came to be on It's Pronounced Metrosexual, and I won't repeat myself here. What I'll say instead are a few things that I don't think I've written:</description></item><item><title>A Guide to Gender</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/guide-to-gender/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/guide-to-gender/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;A book about gender with no mention of the word &amp;lsquo;hegemony,&amp;rsquo; but plenty of references to Star Wars, The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, and Star Trek&amp;ndash; with less of a focus on overwhelming scholarship and more of a focus on enjoyable learning.&amp;rdquo; (excerpt from the book's (first edition) description)
I wrote this book because a bunch of people asked me to. It was a synthesis of the ideas (1) I had been blogging about; (2) I'd been speaking about; and (3) that helped me better understand my gender, when I first set down the path of understanding.</description></item><item><title>The Genderbread Person</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/genderbread-person/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/genderbread-person/</guid><description>I published my first version of the Genderbread Person, an adorable, digestible model for understanding the complexity of gender, to accompany an essay in 2011 (and made a more printer-friendly version early in 2012).
I went on to create several versions of this model, improving and tweaking it based on feedback, and it's been adapted and remixed by countless other educators and organizations over the years.
This was my spin on an idea that I was taught on back in college (in the early 2000s), which goes back in different forms for many decades.</description></item><item><title>It's Pronounced Metrosexual</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/its-pronounced-metrosexual/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/its-pronounced-metrosexual/</guid><description>I wrote the show that became &amp;ldquo;It's Pronounced Metrosexual&amp;rdquo; while I was in grad school.
It was my &amp;ldquo;Plan B&amp;rdquo; for if I don't find a job in higher education. We were still in a recession, and jobs were tough to come by.
The online resource aspect of IPM, by about 100-fold the most popular byproduct of the site, was the result of a suggestion by my partner at the time.</description></item></channel></rss>
