      <description>With guest activists, authors, and artists who have who have been pushed to the fringes by the movement, spent their lives fighting for social justice, or fighting against it, Heretic is a light conversation about the darkness in society.
It&amp;rsquo;s also the scariest thing I&amp;rsquo;ve ever done.
I started writing about The Social Justice Dogma on It&amp;rsquo;s Pronounced Metrosexual in December of 2017.
Visual Design + Identity The branding of Heretic is sunny day at the beach meets Da Vinci Code.</description>

      <description>My third (and final) TEDxTalk, where I present a sort of unified theory of social justice, explaining what it means to &amp;ldquo;do the work,&amp;rdquo; and how we can do it.
I performed this talk at TEDxYouth in San Diego for the theme &amp;ldquo;We Can&amp;rsquo;t Wait.&amp;rdquo; I combined theories from some of my favorite thinkers to create a road map for aspiring social justice advocates.
Unfortunately, due to technical difficulties, video from the event didn&amp;rsquo;t make it to TED&amp;rsquo;s site or YouTube.</description>
