      <description>My now is a lot of new.
The first new &amp;ndash; and this is 100% the most important thing I&amp;rsquo;m working on &amp;ndash; is learning all things puppy. Training? Feeding? Pooping? Scooping? Yes.
As any other expecting parent in 2018, I&amp;rsquo;ve turned to the internet for help.
Good news: lots of people have great advice for me and my pup.
Great news: I&amp;rsquo;m still not an anti-vaxxer.
The new pup is a Morkie, and he&amp;rsquo;ll be making a debut on my Insta any time now.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the seventh version of samuelkillermann.com. At least &amp;ndash; I think that&amp;rsquo;s right. One thing I&amp;rsquo;m sure of: it&amp;rsquo;s been a linear path of &amp;ldquo;Each one is better than the last.&amp;rdquo;
Sometimes embarrassingly better. If you&amp;rsquo;re curious about what the old versions of this site looked like, by all means step into the Wayback Machine and take a tour. Don&amp;rsquo;t say I didn&amp;rsquo;t warn you.
So let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what I&amp;rsquo;ve got going on here.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest: &amp;ldquo;About&amp;rdquo; pages are pretty bleh. For a more fun idea, check out the &amp;ldquo;Now&amp;rdquo; page on this site.
Okay, now that I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten that off my chest &amp;mdash; Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Sam, and I wear a lot of hats. If you&amp;rsquo;ve poked around this site, specifically the work list, you&amp;rsquo;ve likely already figured that out.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing from a coffee shop in Austin, TX where I just spent two hours trying to get this site to deploy on Netlify. Annnnd success?
Success.
This site is part of a huge life restructuring I&amp;rsquo;m currently undertaking. I wrote about it on my blog, but here&amp;rsquo;s the highlighted version:
 My primary org (hues) dissolved in its original vision at the beginning of this year I&amp;rsquo;m no longer with a speaking/talent agency (for the first time in half a decade) And as a result, I&amp;rsquo;ve started to rethink everything I do, mostly in the &amp;ldquo;Can I, and/or do I want to, keep doing this thing?</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Every shirt is political. It’s not just about what a shirt says on the front; it’s about what you’re saying when you buy it or wear it.
If you buy a shirt that was manufactured with unethical labor, you’re making a statement in favor of abuse. The same goes for the corporation who you buy it from, or the materials it’s made with.&amp;rdquo; (from the About Page)</description>

      <guid>https://samuelkillermann.com/work/rest-columns-shadows-healthy-relationship-model/</guid>
      <description>I co-created the Columns &amp;amp; Shadows model with friend / sex educator / curriculum writer extraordinaire Karen Rayne. We put our heads together to help sex educators answer a question a lot of students struggle with: what makes a relationship healthy or unhealthy?
Here&amp;rsquo;s a quote from article I wrote to introduce the Columns &amp;amp; Shadows Model:
 &amp;ldquo;It’s hard to define what a healthy relationship looks like because we all navigate relationships differently.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;When many of us start facilitating, we find ourselves learning a new skill without a lot of guidance or direction. We are passionate about the information and content that we are communicating, but we’re often less versed in tips and techniques regarding how to communicate that information.
This project is a free online resource that is to ensure that none of us have to navigate this world of facilitation without guidance, direction, or support.</description>

      <guid>https://samuelkillermann.com/work/sexualitree/</guid>
      <description>I co-created the Sexualitree model with friend / sex educator / curriculum writer extraordinaire Karen Rayne. We put our heads together to help sex educators introduce a popular concept to students: &amp;ldquo;comprehensive sexuality education.&amp;rdquo;
From the About page:
 &amp;ldquo;The Sexualitree is a way to see how we experience sexuality in different ways. Sexuality affects us on different levels of our lives, and each person uniquely.&amp;rdquo;
  We&amp;rsquo;ve created supplemental materials to help educators use the model, and it&amp;rsquo;s been implemented in dozens of curricula.</description>

      <guid>https://samuelkillermann.com/work/i-heart-singular-they/</guid>
      <description>This adorable, shareable, and oh-so-subtly-activist love poem was inspired by Everyone in the 90s’ experience in high school.
 “Writing with non-gender-neutral pronouns is a serious pain. Some prefer the Frankenword “s/he,” while others rack their brain. Some stick with a particular pronoun for one paragraph or chapter, then swap out the one they’re using; thers alternate “he” and “she” by sentence, or use a plural adapter, but that all sounds confusing.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Have you ever been in a training and marveled at how quickly the time flew by?
Genuinely enjoyed a meeting you were expecting to dread? Learned something powerful about a topic you thought wouldn&amp;rsquo;t engage you? Experienced an intimate, vulnerable, transformative moment with a group of total strangers? Then you&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed the magic of facilitation.&amp;rdquo; (excerpt from the book description)
I wrote Unlocking the Magic of Facilitation with Meg Bolger, after spending a few years doing train-the-trainers with her through The Safe Zone Project.</description>

      <guid>https://samuelkillermann.com/work/ted-x-talk-do-the-work/</guid>
      <description>My third (and final) TEDxTalk, where I present a sort of unified theory of social justice, explaining what it means to &amp;ldquo;do the work,&amp;rdquo; and how we can do it.
I performed this talk at TEDxYouth in San Diego for the theme &amp;ldquo;We Can&amp;rsquo;t Wait.&amp;rdquo; I combined theories from some of my favorite thinkers to create a road map for aspiring social justice advocates.
Unfortunately, due to technical difficulties, video from the event didn&amp;rsquo;t make it to TED&amp;rsquo;s site or YouTube.</description>

      <description>An experiment in gift economy and social justice, SJC is where I serve as Head Elf.
The cards are all doodled and written by me, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the important part.
What&amp;rsquo;s exciting about this project was the bar I set for myself: can I create a business that sells a physical thing that is 100% socially/environmentally/globally just. That is, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t create harm or compromise in any way.
SJC is what was born.</description>

      <description>This is the project that led to The New York Times publishing &amp;ldquo;[Killermann is] perfectly O.K. with being known as the toilet sign guy.&amp;rdquo;
Damn right I am, New York Times! Nothing would make me happier.
 You can read all about how this sign came to be on It&amp;rsquo;s Pronounced Metrosexual, and I won&amp;rsquo;t repeat myself here. What I&amp;rsquo;ll say instead are a few things that I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve written:</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;A book about gender with no mention of the word &amp;lsquo;hegemony,&amp;rsquo; but plenty of references to Star Wars, The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, and Star Trek&amp;ndash; with less of a focus on overwhelming scholarship and more of a focus on enjoyable learning.&amp;rdquo; (excerpt from the book&amp;rsquo;s (first edition) description)
I wrote this book because a bunch of people asked me to. It was a synthesis of the ideas (1) I had been blogging about; (2) I&amp;rsquo;d been speaking about; and (3) that helped me better understand my gender, when I first set down the path of understanding.</description>

      <description>You have been told all your life that you’re unique, you’re special, like a snowflake. Nobody is like you, you’re one in 7 billion (or one in 108 billion, an estimated total number of humans ever, if you want to get technical), and nobody can take that away from you.
Yet at the same time you’ve been told that you can guess that someone else will be like everyone else in a particular group based on their membership in that group (e.</description>

      <guid>https://samuelkillermann.com/work/genderbread-person/</guid>
      <description>I published my first version of the Genderbread Person, an adorable, digestible model for understanding the complexity of gender, to accompany an essay in 2011 (and made a more printer-friendly version early in 2012).
 I went on to create several versions of this model, improving and tweaking it based on feedback, and it&amp;rsquo;s been adapted and remixed by countless other educators and organizations over the years.
This was my spin on an idea that I was taught on back in college (in the early 2000s), which goes back in different forms for many decades.</description>

      <description>I wrote the show that became &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Pronounced Metrosexual&amp;rdquo; while I was in grad school.
It was my &amp;ldquo;Plan B&amp;rdquo; for if I don&amp;rsquo;t find a job in higher education. We were still in a recession, and jobs were tough to come by.
The online resource aspect of IPM, by about 100-fold the most popular byproduct of the site, was the result of a suggestion by my partner at the time.</description>
