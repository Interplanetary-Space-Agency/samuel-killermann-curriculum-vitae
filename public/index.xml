      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest: about pages are pretty bleh. For a more fun idea, check out the &amp;ldquo;now&amp;rdquo; page on this site.
Okay, now that I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten that off my chest &amp;mdash; Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Sam, and I wear a lot of hats. If you&amp;rsquo;ve poked around this site, specifically the work page, you&amp;rsquo;ve likely already figured that out.
I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what you want to know about me, so I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to answer the most common questions I get asked from crowd members and readers.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing from a coffee shop in Austin, TX where I just spent two hours trying to get this site to deploy on Netlify. Annnnd success?
Success.
This site is part of a huge life restructuring I&amp;rsquo;m currently undertaking. I wrote about it on my blog, but here&amp;rsquo;s the highlighted version:
 My primary org (hues) dissolved in its original vision at the beginning of this year I&amp;rsquo;m no longer with a speaking/talent agency (for the first time in half a decade) And as a result, I&amp;rsquo;ve started to rethink everything I do, mostly in the &amp;ldquo;Can I, and/or do I want to, keep doing this thing?</description>

      <description>I wrote the show that became &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Pronounced Metrosexual&amp;rdquo; while I was in grad school.
It was my &amp;ldquo;Plan B&amp;rdquo; for if I don&amp;rsquo;t find a job in higher education. We were still in a recession, and jobs were tough to come by.
The online resource aspect of IPM, by about 100-fold the most popular byproduct of the site, was the result of a suggestion by my partner at the time.</description>
