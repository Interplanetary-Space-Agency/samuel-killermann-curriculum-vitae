And it's not just IPM, I'm rummaging through the hues workshop and grabbing everything that isn't passed its expiration date.
But it really started with IPM. I realized a few months ago how inaccessible IPM was, despite that being one of my core values.
Sadly, IPM wasn't accessible in three different ways:
For blind and low-vision users, IPM was difficult/impossible to use; For people in parts of the world that have low-bandwidth or slow internet, IPM was a pain to load (despite being faster than 90% of websites, according to Google); and For how expensive it was to host, I couldn't afford spikes in traffic, so it was becoming difficult to deliver it as a free resource (because I stopped performing the show to fund it) Now, as a result of this months-long rebuilding process, IPM is more accessible than ever &amp;ndash; improving its presence in the 230+ countries it reaches every year, and for all the blind and low-vision activists who come by.</description></item><item><title>Taking the Dogma out of Social Justice</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/now/2019-june/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/now/2019-june/</guid><description>Yesterday, I sent emails to several thousand people, making the Social Justice, Minus Dogma Online Course + Community as official as it will ever be. Within moments, we had 7 people enrolled. Within 30 minutes, I was reviewing the first submitted response from a student.
That was a little bewildering to me.
Someone who, before getting that email, couldn't have possibly been expecting to enroll in a 6-week course during lunch, was already halfway through orientation before I had finished sending everyone emails about it.</description></item><item><title>Social Justice, Minus Dogma</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/social-justice-minus-dogma/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/social-justice-minus-dogma/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;If you’re willing to challenge your personal comfort, prioritize bravery over ideological safety, be humble with your learning &amp;amp; generous with your teaching, and push dogma, performance, &amp;amp; posturing to the side in favor of outcomes, action, &amp;amp; authenticity, this is the space you’ve been looking for.

Both are well underway, with lots of things you can check out right now.
One is a Social Justice, Minus Dogma Online Course &amp;amp; Community, which lives at www.sjmd.space.
This was the result of asking people on IPM if it was something they'd want, and having (now) thousands of people reply &amp;ldquo;Yes!&amp;rdquo; I'm creating the project in the spirit of a MOOC, but with a lot of twists and turns in response to the delicate &amp;ndash; and potentially nuclear &amp;ndash; nature of our subject.</description></item><item><title>Defining LGBTQ+</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/defining-lgbtq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/defining-lgbtq/</guid><description>Defining LGBTQ+, A Guide to Gender &amp;amp; Sexuality Terminology is a printer-friendly (8.5&amp;rdquo; x 11&amp;rdquo; format), short e-book (just 37 pages), that is better thought of as an elaborately annotated glossary than a book-book.

“Writing with non-gender-neutral pronouns is a serious pain. Some prefer the Frankenword “s/he,” while others rack their brain.
