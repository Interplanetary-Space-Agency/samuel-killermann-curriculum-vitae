      <description>This adorable, shareable, and oh-so-subtly-activist love poem was inspired by Everyone in the 90s’ experience in high school.
 “Writing with non-gender-neutral pronouns is a serious pain. Some prefer the Frankenword “s/he,” while others rack their brain. Some stick with a particular pronoun for one paragraph or chapter, then swap out the one they’re using; thers alternate “he” and “she” by sentence, or use a plural adapter, but that all sounds confusing.</description>

      <title>All Gender Restroom Sign</title>

      <description>This is the project that led to The New York Times publishing &amp;ldquo;[Killermann is] perfectly O.K. with being known as the toilet sign guy.&amp;rdquo;
Damn right I am, New York Times! Nothing would make me happier.
 You can read all about how this sign came to be on It&amp;rsquo;s Pronounced Metrosexual, and I won&amp;rsquo;t repeat myself here. What I&amp;rsquo;ll say instead are a few things that I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve written:</description>

      <title>A Guide to Gender</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;A book about gender with no mention of the word &amp;lsquo;hegemony,&amp;rsquo; but plenty of references to Star Wars, The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, and Star Trek&amp;ndash; with less of a focus on overwhelming scholarship and more of a focus on enjoyable learning.&amp;rdquo; (excerpt from the book&amp;rsquo;s (first edition) description)
I wrote this book because a bunch of people asked me to. It was a synthesis of the ideas (1) I had been blogging about; (2) I&amp;rsquo;d been speaking about; and (3) that helped me better understand my gender, when I first set down the path of understanding.</description>

      <title>The Genderbread Person</title>
      <link>https://samuelkillermann.com/work/genderbread-person/</link>

      <description>I published my first version of the Genderbread Person, an adorable, digestible model for understanding the complexity of gender, to accompany an essay in 2011 (and made a more printer-friendly version early in 2012).
 I went on to create several versions of this model, improving and tweaking it based on feedback, and it&amp;rsquo;s been adapted and remixed by countless other educators and organizations over the years.
This was my spin on an idea that I was taught on back in college (in the early 2000s), which goes back in different forms for many decades.</description>

      <title>It&#39;s Pronounced Metrosexual</title>

      <description>I wrote the show that became &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Pronounced Metrosexual&amp;rdquo; while I was in grad school.
It was my &amp;ldquo;Plan B&amp;rdquo; for if I don&amp;rsquo;t find a job in higher education. We were still in a recession, and jobs were tough to come by.
The online resource aspect of IPM, by about 100-fold the most popular byproduct of the site, was the result of a suggestion by my partner at the time.</description>
