It originated from the glossary of A Guide to Gender and my post Comprehensive List of LGBTQ+ Vocabulary Definitions, which evolved into a collaboration with Meg Bolger as the Core Vocabulary for our Foundational Safe Zone Curriculum.</description></item><item><title>Safe Zone Train-the-Trainer Retreat Guide</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/train-the-trainer-retreat-guide/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/train-the-trainer-retreat-guide/</guid><description>As part of our ongoing Train-the-Trainer Toolkit, Meg &amp;amp; I wrote and published a comprehensive retreat guide for Safe Zone Train-the-Trainers.
It includes (from the blog post announcement):
All the individual activities we’d recommend for a TTT, from the LGBTQ+ content knowledge to the facilitator skills Advice on logistics, participant selection, supplies, prep, etc. A retreat schedule with detailed walkthroughs for every step And a whole lot more. Like with our Foundational Curriculum, we offer this to you as editable Google Docs for your customizing convenience.</description></item><item><title>The Safe Zone Project 2.0</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/safe-zone-project-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/safe-zone-project-2/</guid><description>The Safe Zone Project 2.0 is what Meg &amp;amp; I have been saying to refer to the revamp of the online resource, so that's what I'll call it here.
Highlights of Version 2.0:
Online courses, with a seamlessly integrated learning management system A clearinghouse of resources for launching your own Safe Zone program (called the Train-the-Trainer Toolkit) Improved accessibility, site structure, usability, and site speed A new record for curriculum downloads in a month: 1,432 (our old record was 690) Backstory Meg and I initially created The Safe Zone Project in 2013 to serve as a free online resource for folks doing LGBTQ awareness and ally trainings (AKA &amp;ldquo;safe zone trainings&amp;rdquo;).</description></item><item><title>I Heart Singular They</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/i-heart-singular-they/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/i-heart-singular-they/</guid><description>This adorable, shareable, and oh-so-subtly-activist love poem was inspired by Everyone in the 90s’ experience in high school.
“Writing with non-gender-neutral pronouns is a serious pain. Some prefer the Frankenword “s/he,” while others rack their brain. Some stick with a particular pronoun for one paragraph or chapter, then swap out the one they’re using; thers alternate “he” and “she” by sentence, or use a plural adapter, but that all sounds confusing.</description></item><item><title>All Gender Restroom Sign</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/all-gender-restroom-sign/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/all-gender-restroom-sign/</guid><description>This is the project that led to The New York Times publishing &amp;ldquo;[Killermann is] perfectly O.K. with being known as the toilet sign guy.&amp;rdquo;
Damn right I am, New York Times! Nothing would make me happier.
You can read all about how this sign came to be on It's Pronounced Metrosexual, and I won't repeat myself here. What I'll say instead are a few things that I don't think I've written:</description></item><item><title>A Guide to Gender</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/guide-to-gender/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/guide-to-gender/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;A book about gender with no mention of the word &amp;lsquo;hegemony,&amp;rsquo; but plenty of references to Star Wars, The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, and Star Trek&amp;ndash; with less of a focus on overwhelming scholarship and more of a focus on enjoyable learning.&amp;rdquo; (excerpt from the book's (first edition) description)
I wrote this book because a bunch of people asked me to. It was a synthesis of the ideas (1) I had been blogging about; (2) I'd been speaking about; and (3) that helped me better understand my gender, when I first set down the path of understanding.</description></item><item><title>The Safe Zone Project</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/safe-zone-project/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/safe-zone-project/</guid><description>Meg and I created The Safe Zone Project in 2013 to serve as a free online resource for folks doing LGBTQ awareness and ally trainings (AKA &amp;ldquo;safe zone trainings&amp;rdquo;).</description></item><item><title>TEDxTalk: Understanding the Complexities of Gender</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/ted-x-talk-understanding-the-complexities-of-gender/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/ted-x-talk-understanding-the-complexities-of-gender/</guid><description>My second TEDxTalk, disentangling gender identity, expression, and sex in a fun and sometimes-rhyming way.</description></item><item><title>The Genderbread Person</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/genderbread-person/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/genderbread-person/</guid><description>I published my first version of the Genderbread Person, an adorable, digestible model for understanding the complexity of gender, to accompany an essay in 2011 (and made a more printer-friendly version early in 2012).
I went on to create several versions of this model, improving and tweaking it based on feedback, and it's been adapted and remixed by countless other educators and organizations over the years.
This was my spin on an idea that I was taught on back in college (in the early 2000s), which goes back in different forms for many decades.</description></item><item><title>It's Pronounced Metrosexual</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/its-pronounced-metrosexual/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/its-pronounced-metrosexual/</guid><description>I wrote the show that became &amp;ldquo;It's Pronounced Metrosexual&amp;rdquo; while I was in grad school.
It was my &amp;ldquo;Plan B&amp;rdquo; for if I don't find a job in higher education. We were still in a recession, and jobs were tough to come by.
The online resource aspect of IPM, by about 100-fold the most popular byproduct of the site, was the result of a suggestion by my partner at the time.</description></item></channel></rss>
