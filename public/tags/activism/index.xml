It’s not just about what a shirt says on the front; it’s about what you’re saying when you buy it or wear it.

The cards are all doodled and written by me, but that's not the important part.
What's exciting about this project was the bar I set for myself: can I create a business that sells a physical thing that is 100% socially/environmentally/globally just. That is, that doesn't create harm or compromise in any way.

I wrote this book because a bunch of people asked me to. It was a synthesis of the ideas (1) I had been blogging about; (2) I'd been speaking about; and (3) that helped me better understand my gender, when I first set down the path of understanding.</description></item><item><title>TEDxTalk: The Cost of Dreams</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/ted-x-talk-cost-of-dreams/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/ted-x-talk-cost-of-dreams/</guid><description>My first TEDxTalk, about the ideas of chasing your dreams, what's at stake, and what we have to lose.</description></item><item><title>It's Pronounced Metrosexual</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/its-pronounced-metrosexual/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/its-pronounced-metrosexual/</guid><description>I wrote the show that became &amp;ldquo;It's Pronounced Metrosexual&amp;rdquo; while I was in grad school.
