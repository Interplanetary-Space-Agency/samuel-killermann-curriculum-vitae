      <description>The Safe Zone Project 2.0 is what Meg &amp;amp; I have been saying to refer to the revamp of the online resource, so that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ll call it here.
Highlights of Version 2.0:
 Online courses, with a seamlessly integrated learning management system A clearinghouse of resources for launching your own Safe Zone program (called the Train-the-Trainer Toolkit) Improved accessibility, site structure, usability, and site speed A new record for curriculum downloads in a month: 1,432 (our old record was 690)    Backstory Meg and I initially created The Safe Zone Project in 2013 to serve as a free online resource for folks doing LGBTQ awareness and ally trainings (AKA &amp;ldquo;safe zone trainings&amp;rdquo;).</description>

      <description>Welcome to the seventh version of samuelkillermann.com. At least &amp;ndash; I think that&amp;rsquo;s right. One thing I&amp;rsquo;m sure of: it&amp;rsquo;s been a linear path of &amp;ldquo;Each one is better than the last.&amp;rdquo;
Sometimes embarrassingly better. If you&amp;rsquo;re curious about what the old versions of this site looked like, by all means step into the Wayback Machine and take a tour. Don&amp;rsquo;t say I didn&amp;rsquo;t warn you.
So let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what I&amp;rsquo;ve got going on here.</description>

      <title>Facilitating XYZ</title>
      <link>https://samuelkillermann.com/work/facilitating-xyz/</link>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;When many of us start facilitating, we find ourselves learning a new skill without a lot of guidance or direction. We are passionate about the information and content that we are communicating, but weâ€™re often less versed in tips and techniques regarding how to communicate that information.
This project is a free online resource that is to ensure that none of us have to navigate this world of facilitation without guidance, direction, or support.</description>

      <title>The Sexualitree</title>
      <link>https://samuelkillermann.com/work/sexualitree/</link>

      <description>I co-created the Sexualitree model with friend / sex educator / curriculum writer extraordinaire Karen Rayne. We put our heads together to help sex educators introduce a popular concept to students: &amp;ldquo;comprehensive sexuality education.&amp;rdquo;
From the About page:
 &amp;ldquo;The Sexualitree is a way to see how we experience sexuality in different ways. Sexuality affects us on different levels of our lives, and each person uniquely.&amp;rdquo;
  We&amp;rsquo;ve created supplemental materials to help educators use the model, and it&amp;rsquo;s been implemented in dozens of curricula.</description>

      <title>It&#39;s Pronounced Metrosexual</title>
      <link>https://samuelkillermann.com/work/its-pronounced-metrosexual/</link>

      <description>I wrote the show that became &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Pronounced Metrosexual&amp;rdquo; while I was in grad school.
It was my &amp;ldquo;Plan B&amp;rdquo; for if I don&amp;rsquo;t find a job in higher education. We were still in a recession, and jobs were tough to come by.
The online resource aspect of IPM, by about 100-fold the most popular byproduct of the site, was the result of a suggestion by my partner at the time.</description>
