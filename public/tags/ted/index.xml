I performed this talk at TEDxYouth in San Diego for the theme &amp;ldquo;We Can't Wait.&amp;rdquo; I combined theories from some of my favorite thinkers to create a road map for aspiring social justice advocates.
Unfortunately, due to technical difficulties, video from the event didn't make it to TED's site or YouTube.</description></item><item><title>TEDxTalk: Understanding the Complexities of Gender</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/ted-x-talk-understanding-the-complexities-of-gender/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/ted-x-talk-understanding-the-complexities-of-gender/</guid><description>My second TEDxTalk, disentangling gender identity, expression, and sex in a fun and sometimes-rhyming way.</description></item><item><title>TEDxTalk: The Cost of Dreams</title><link>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/ted-x-talk-cost-of-dreams/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.samuelkillermann.com/work/ted-x-talk-cost-of-dreams/</guid><description>My first TEDxTalk, about the ideas of chasing your dreams, what's at stake, and what we have to lose.</description></item></channel></rss>
