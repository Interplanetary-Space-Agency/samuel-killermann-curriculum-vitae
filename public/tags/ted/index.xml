      <description>My third (and final) TEDxTalk, where I present a sort of unified theory of social justice, explaining what it means to &amp;ldquo;do the work,&amp;rdquo; and how we can do it.
I performed this talk at TEDxYouth in San Diego for the theme &amp;ldquo;We Can&amp;rsquo;t Wait.&amp;rdquo; I combined theories from some of my favorite thinkers to create a road map for aspiring social justice advocates.
Unfortunately, due to technical difficulties, video from the event didn&amp;rsquo;t make it to TED&amp;rsquo;s site or YouTube.</description>
