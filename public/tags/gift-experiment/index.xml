      <description>Be My Boss(es) is a splash page for my Patreon profile, explaining how I am doing Patreon, and patronage, for anyone who wants to employ me.
I built it with Hugo and it&amp;rsquo;s being served up with Netlify &amp;ndash; just like this site you&amp;rsquo;re reading this on.

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Every shirt is political. It’s not just about what a shirt says on the front; it’s about what you’re saying when you buy it or wear it.
If you buy a shirt that was manufactured with unethical labor, you’re making a statement in favor of abuse. The same goes for the corporation who you buy it from, or the materials it’s made with.&amp;rdquo; (from the About Page)</description>

      <title>Socially Just Cards</title>

      <description>An experiment in gift economy and social justice, SJC is where I serve as Head Elf.
The cards are all doodled and written by me, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the important part.
What&amp;rsquo;s exciting about this project was the bar I set for myself: can I create a business that sells a physical thing that is 100% socially/environmentally/globally just. That is, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t create harm or compromise in any way.
SJC is what was born.</description>
