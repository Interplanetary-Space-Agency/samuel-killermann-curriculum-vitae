      <description>Welcome to the seventh version of samuelkillermann.com. At least &amp;ndash; I think that&amp;rsquo;s right. One thing I&amp;rsquo;m sure of: it&amp;rsquo;s been a linear path of &amp;ldquo;Each one is better than the last.&amp;rdquo;
Sometimes embarrassingly better. If you&amp;rsquo;re curious about what the old versions of this site looked like, by all means step into the Wayback Machine and take a tour. Don&amp;rsquo;t say I didn&amp;rsquo;t warn you.
So let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what I&amp;rsquo;ve got going on here.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Magic of Facilitation</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Have you ever been in a training and marveled at how quickly the time flew by?
Genuinely enjoyed a meeting you were expecting to dread? Learned something powerful about a topic you thought wouldn&amp;rsquo;t engage you? Experienced an intimate, vulnerable, transformative moment with a group of total strangers? Then you&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed the magic of facilitation.&amp;rdquo; (excerpt from the book description)
I wrote Unlocking the Magic of Facilitation with Meg Bolger, after spending a few years doing train-the-trainers with her through The Safe Zone Project.</description>

      <title>A Guide to Gender</title>
      <link>https://samuelkillermann.com/work/guide-to-gender/</link>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;A book about gender with no mention of the word &amp;lsquo;hegemony,&amp;rsquo; but plenty of references to Star Wars, The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, and Star Trek&amp;ndash; with less of a focus on overwhelming scholarship and more of a focus on enjoyable learning.&amp;rdquo; (excerpt from the book&amp;rsquo;s (first edition) description)
I wrote this book because a bunch of people asked me to. It was a synthesis of the ideas (1) I had been blogging about; (2) I&amp;rsquo;d been speaking about; and (3) that helped me better understand my gender, when I first set down the path of understanding.</description>

      <description>Meg and I created The Safe Zone Project in 2013 to serve as a free online resource for folks doing LGBTQ awareness and ally trainings (AKA &amp;ldquo;safe zone trainings&amp;rdquo;).

      <title>It&#39;s Pronounced Metrosexual</title>

      <description>I wrote the show that became &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Pronounced Metrosexual&amp;rdquo; while I was in grad school.
It was my &amp;ldquo;Plan B&amp;rdquo; for if I don&amp;rsquo;t find a job in higher education. We were still in a recession, and jobs were tough to come by.
The online resource aspect of IPM, by about 100-fold the most popular byproduct of the site, was the result of a suggestion by my partner at the time.</description>
