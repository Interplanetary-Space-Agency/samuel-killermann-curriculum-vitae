  <div class="post-content"><p>Sam Killermann is a comedian, author, and award-winning activist. Sam travels the world performing comedy shows and giving talks on themes of social justice, gender, and sexuality.</p>

<p>Killermann&rsquo;s work (that he uncopyrighted in 2013) has been downloaded by hundreds of millions of people around the world who utilize it to bolster their educational efforts toward global equity. His versions of the <a href="http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/03/the-genderbread-person-v2-0/">Genderbread Person</a>, a model for understanding and teaching gender and sexual diversity, have been translated into over a dozen languages.</p>

<p>In 2017, Sam was profiled in National Geographic&rsquo;s documentary &ldquo;Gender Revolution: A Journey with Katie Couric. In 2014, Sam designed an <a href="http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2014/07/how-the-gender-neutral-bathroom-sign-i-made-is-being-manufactured-and-donated-to-colleges/">all-gender restroom sign</a> that he gifted to the commons, which is now being implemented on three continents, was featured in the White House, and is becoming the standard for dozens of communities around the U.S. and world.</p>

<p>Sam is the author of several books, including <a href="http://www.guidetogender.com">A Guide to Gender</a>, which is an exploration of gender from a social justice perspective, with humor and comics sprinkled in. The book opened as the #1 bestseller in gender on Amazon, and as a reflection of Sam&rsquo;s commitment to access as a core social justice value, he&rsquo;s given away over 20,000 copies of the book. He gave a well-received <a href="http://youtu.be/NRcPXtqdKjE">TEDxTalk</a> that has over 300,000 views called &ldquo;Understanding the Complexities of Gender,&rdquo; where he distilled the themes of the book into a few minutes of fun, energetic, and easily-digestible speech.</p>

<p>Sam is the co-creator of <a href="http://thesafezoneproject.com">TheSafeZoneProject.com</a>, a free online resource for LGBTQ and Ally training materials. The open source curriculum they published is being used by over 17,000 educators in at least 100 countries.</p>

<p>Outside of his key initiatives, Sam is a frequent keynote speaker, makes political shirts for <a href="http://everyshirtispolitical.com">EveryShirtIsPolitical</a>, co-facilitates <a href="http://facilitating.xyz">FaciltiatingXYZ</a>,  was named a &ldquo;Person We Love&rdquo; by Yes! Magazine, Austin &ldquo;Changemaker,&rdquo; ¬†and is always dreaming up new social good projects. When he&rsquo;s not on the road, he likes to spend at least a few hours a day bicycling around sunny Austin, TX, where he counts himself lucky to live.</p>
